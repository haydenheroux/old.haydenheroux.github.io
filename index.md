I am a programmer with years of experience writing command-line and graphical tools in C, Go, Rust, and Python. Much of my previous work involved writing web scrapers using Beautiful Soup and using Pandas or R for data analysis, alongside programming visualizers and dashboards in various UI/UX frameworks. In addition to my work on these tools, I have programmed autonomous and real-time robotics software in Java for the FIRST Robotics Competition and maintained my team’s public libraries on GitHub. At the moment, I am diving deep into backend programming using the Gin web framework, and making use of Rust’s runtime stability, productivity, and performance enhancements to rewrite C tools in a modern language.
